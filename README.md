# Controller to Node-RED Translator (CNT)

## Overview
We present a controller to Node-RED translator (CNT), a tool for developing Node-RED systems that are safe and easy to update continuously. CNT introduces the discrete controller synthesis to conventional Node-RED systems to provide a guarantee of ï¬‚ow correctness (safety). Flow correctness, which essentially means that the nodes fire at the timing intended by the designer, is crucial in smart city systems that require frequent application updates with no room for design errors. In this work, we propose a method for developing a Node-RED system using CNT along with its accompanying algorithm. We also report the results of experiments that demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method.


## Configuration
There are three types of tools available here. The roles and details of each tool are shown below.
* M-Sec_Translator (CNT)
```
This is the main tool of this research, which converts the controllers automatically generated by MTSA into ".json" format that can be used with Node-Red.
```
* M-Sec_Node-RED
```
We have prepared Node-Red as a development environment with docker. You can read the ".json" file converted by CNT in this environment. Our Node-RED is equipped with SoxFire, which is used for developing smart city systems. We recommend that you use our Node-RED to run the sample program. You can get the general Node-Red from this URL (https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-red).
```
* M-Sec_DemoTool
```
To demonstrate the effectiveness of this research, the M-Sec project has created a demonstration system. As a demonstration system, we designed a video release system. By using Node-RED to send video to this demo system via http request, the sent video will be displayed. Since there are two types of video destinations (user types), Node-RED can guarantee privacy requirements that vary depending on the user.
```

In addition, the discrete controller synthesis tool "MTSA" is required for development using this tool.
MTSA can be obtained from this URL (https://mtsa.dc.uba.ar/).


## How to use


Detailed instructions for each tool can be found in the README of each folder (each tool).
